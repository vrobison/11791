This talk will analyze&#10;  the ‘Speech Circle’ that enables a person to maintain&#10;  a dialog with a machine using speech recognition,&#10;  spoken language understanding, dialog management and&#10;  spoken language generation, and finally text-to-speech&#10;  synthesis, and show where significant progress has&#10;  been made, and where there remain critical problems&#10;  that need to be addressed and solved.&#10;&#10;  The talk will include several audio and video examples&#10;  of speech recognition and speech understanding systems&#10;  that have been studied in the laboratory to illustrate&#10;  the challenges that remain to be solved before speech&#10;  recognition is considered a solved problem. &#10;&#10;       &#10;"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13 21"/></xmi:XMI>
